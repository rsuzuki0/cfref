NAME
     cfref - generate C function cross reference

SYNOPSIS
     cfref [ -_v-_h-? ][ -L ][ -l _l_i_s_t_f_i_l_e ][ -f ][ -ip  ][  -il  ]
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_s..

DESCRIPTION
     The main purpose of this program is make  it  easy  to  read
     someone's or maintain own code.

     It can generate reports consist  of  only  watching  symbols
     with  -l or -L. -l needs a _l_i_s_t_f_i_l_e , listed all the symbols
     _n_o_t  watching,  a  symbol  per  a  line  format.   -L   uses
     /usr/local/lib/funclist,   the   same  format,  need  to  be
     prepared in advance, insted of it. Probably   -L  is  useful
     for  disable  to  report  previously  provided functions(ex.
     standards, systems, &c).

     _c_f_r_e_f reports into stdout unless -f is specified. Then, into
     the  file  that has the same basename as source and .cf suf-
     fix.  In case that a executable will be compiled  from  more
     than  one  sourcefile, analyzing all sources at a time makes
     better result.

FILE
     /usr/local/lib/funclist  Table of standard and system  func-
     tions.

BUGS
     Looking  synbols  up  using  incomplete  set  of  characters
     allowed to compose a symbol.

     Preprocessor delective is to be ignored.

     _c_f_r_e_f is written in ANSI C and able to  analyze  sourcecodes
     only written in ANSI C.
